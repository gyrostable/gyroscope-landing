# Revolution in Resilience.

### Gyroscope is bringing clarity and resilience to DeFi.

DeFi is still far from reaching its full potential.

Gyroscope is reconstructing Web3 market infrastructure in a more resilient and more transparent manner.

**Web3 infrastructure should not ask for trust, it should beget it.** Transparent automation is one of the core value propositions of Web3 and is a foundation for trust. From rules-based monetary policy, to providing clarity over the current system state - Gyroscope will be transparent and based on smart-contract encoded rules.

**Web3 infrastructure should be governed by its users.** While short-term responses can be automated, decentralized governance must lead the long-term evolution. Toward this end, we combine the best of technology and community to create “a cyberspace not only occupied, but governed by its citizens” [^1]. Gyroscope will ensure that everyone participating in the protocol is empowered to govern its evolution.

**Web3 infrastructure should be open.** There is great merit in building from first principles and adopting good ideas irrespective of where they come from. While the bar must be high, existing ‘lego blocks’ [^2] should be repurposed whenever possible. The Gyroscope protocol should always be open to ideas, users, and developers.
